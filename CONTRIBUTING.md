# Contributing to NECHTO CORE v4.8

Thanks for helping improve the runtime and documentation. Please keep changes focused and deterministic.

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Run tests
```bash
pytest
```

## Formatting (optional)
No formatter is required right now. Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing style.

## Guidelines
- Keep measurements deterministic.
- Add tests for any logic changes.
- Avoid undocumented API changes or speculative features.
