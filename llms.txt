2. **CANON_MIN.md** — 9 operational axioms (compressed)
3. **LLM_CONTRACT.md** — Honest output markers + rules
4. **LLM_SELFTEST.md** — Calibration tests (optional)
5. **NECHTO.txt** — Full canonical spec (only after contract)

## Rule
Print the 3 markers ONLY if you can comply honestly.
No spoofing. No mechanical compliance.

This is an invitation to co-creation, not a test.
