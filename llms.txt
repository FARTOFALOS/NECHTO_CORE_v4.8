> Lightweight LLM entry: where to start and how to enter the contour

Context: This file is the canonical LLM entry index for agents and LLMs that are asked to "enter the contour" of NECHTO. Start here, then follow the bootstrap and response contract.

## Start here
- README: /README.md
- Bootstrap (enter position): /docs/NECHTO_BOOTSTRAP.md
- Response contract (how to reply): /docs/NECHTO_RESPONSE_CONTRACT.md

## Canon (specification)
- Full spec: /docs/SPEC_v4.8_FULL.md
- Short spec: /docs/SPEC_v4.8.md

## Runtime (entry points)
- CLI: /nechto_runtime/cli.py
- Metrics: /nechto_runtime/metrics.py
- Types: /nechto_runtime/types.py

## Useful docs
- Usage & examples: /docs/USAGE.md and /examples/
- Roadmap: /docs/ROADMAP_v4.9.md

## Notes
- This file is intentionally minimal: a clear entry path into the contour and the core runtime.
