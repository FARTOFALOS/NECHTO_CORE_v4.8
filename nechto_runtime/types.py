"""Type definitions for the minimal NECHTO runtime.

These dataclasses represent the fundamental objects manipulated by the
runtime: semantic atoms (nodes), edges, attention vectors, the global
state and epistemic claims.  They follow the structure sketched in
Part 3 of the NECHTO v4.8 specification.  Default values are chosen
conservatively so that missing fields never silently imply safety; if
information is absent the metrics logic will mark the associated
objects as high risk during measurement.
